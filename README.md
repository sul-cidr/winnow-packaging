# winnow-packaging

## Download Instructions

* Download the latest release from the GitHub Releases page: https://github.com/sul-cidr/winnow-packaging/releases/latest
  * If you're on Windows, we recommend using a browser other than MS Edge to download the file, as Edge will make you jump through several additional steps before allowing you to download the file (see below).

* Allow the app to execute on your system (Mac/Windows)
  * Both Mac and Windows will raise spurious warnings about "unknown executables" and "unknown publishers" unless developers pay them for the right to make applications that don't raise these warnings.  If you see these warnings, follow the steps below to allow the application to execute on your system.


### Mac

Note: these steps and screenshots come from macOS 10.15 Catalina; wording and steps may differ a little on other versions.

1. When you first attempt to launch Winnow you may see the following dialog.  Click the <kbd>?</kbd> button and close this dialog.
